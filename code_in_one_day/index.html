	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	
	<h4> Hello! I am a UX designer from Los Angeles with a background in social media, digital marketing and graphic design. </h4>

	<p> I’m fascinated with finding creative ways to solve problems and tell stories, even the messy process it entails. I thrive in situations that blend creativity with logic and reason, from designing something beautiful to analyzing problems to their core. </p>

	<p> I’m passionate about volunteering my skills for important causes, particularly political activism, gun control and helping those less fortunate. Currently, I’m a designer and committee member for nonprofit Sugar & Stilettos, a small but mighty all-female team that’s fundraised over $200k for the Westside Food Bank. </p>
